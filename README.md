# Freq-Common-Words
This is one of the first programming assignments I did when taking the course -- Big Data for Data Science. This assignment was to get me familiarized with Hadoop. 

### Problem Statement 

Given two textual files, count the number of words that are common. Remove stop-words found in Stopwords.txt and sort the common words in descending order of the smaller number of occurences in the two files. 

This task was done in Java.
